We are always glad to get peoples' interest and spare time... but what else might you be able to help us with?

Some things, we have a steady need for:
<ul>
<li>Computer parts</i>
<li>Your skills and knowledge</li>
</ul>

Other times, we're looking for a certain specific odd or end, for this project or that:
<ul>
<li><s>An old smoke detector (the Americium element can be used in in cloud chamber)</s> We got one of these!</li>
</ul>

And, though we're becoming less nomadic, we are still looking around for a more optimal physical location... if you hear of anything, let us know!
