Society is reeling from the twin crises of a brtual coronavirus pandemic and an economic kernel panic. How have hackers and makers been stepping up to the challenge?

<H3>Making bleach</H3>
With store shelves empty of essentials like cleaning supplies, it's time to look around for a way to make them from scratch. Here's one example: washing soda (sodium carbonate) is added to swimming pool chlorinating granules (calcium hypochlorite). Chalk powder (calcium carbonate) precipitates, leaving liquid bleach (sodium hypochlorite) to be decanted off. <center><div class="eq-c">
Ca(ClO)<sub>2</sub><i>(aq)</i> + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub><i>(aq)</i> <span class="arrow arrow-right">&rarr;</span> CaCO<sub>3</sub><i>(s)</i> + 2NaClO<i>(aq)</i>
</div></center><br>
Our first run at the Recybery yielded five and a half gallons of 6% bleach! They were donated to groups like the local Food Not Bombs chapter.

<H3>Sewing face masks</H3>

Supplies of N95 masks have been exhausted by medical demand; fortunately, cloth masks are easy to make! They function primarily to filter small droplets that spray when we cough, talk, and breath. Because these droplets can transmit the virus, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">CDC has recently recommended the use of cloth masks in public</a>, even providing instructions for making your own. (When the feds are offering clever lifehacks by way of public health assistance, you might be living in a failed state!)  A recent study under review found that, as a complement to other strategies, <a href = "https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0203/v1">"The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts." </a> Suffice to say, the Singer Featherweight has been running full tilt! We've been using the <a href = "https://www.masksoflove.org/"> "Masks of Love" pattern </a>. We ran out of cloth for a moment, but thanks to a generous donation from <a href="https://communityworxnc.org/">CommunityWorx Thrift Store</a>, we're back up and running!

<H3>Folding At Home</H3>
One of the first things the Recybery worked on was crunching numbers for <a href="http://recybery.space/project/2015/07/22/scientificprogressBOINC/">distributed scientific computing through BOINC</a>. FoldingAtHome is one such distributed computing project; it runs protein dynamic simulations for biomedical researchers, and has recently taken on COVID-19 reseach, looking for therapeutic targets. Our computer is contributing to the HackADay team - <a href="https://stats.foldingathome.org/donor/carrboroRecybery">check out our stats!</a>

<center><H2>and Beyond</H2></center>
Here's a few of the things that are going on elsewhere:

<H3>Faceshields from UNC BEAM</H3>
Medical workers have found themselves without protective face shields - the university makerspace, BEAM, <a href="https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2020/04/students-making-masks-0414">has stepped in to fabricate them by the hundred, while maintaining protocols for working safely during a pandemic!</a> We gave them a gallon of bleach so they could keep running.

<H3>Triangle mutual aid</H3>
You might have seen portable handwashing stations popping up around town - they're <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/Help-Build-Portable-Hand-Washing-Stations">a project of Triangle Mutual Aid and Bonneville Electric</a>. They're following the build instructions found <a href="http://www.indigenousaction.org/diy-emergency-handwashing-station-instructions-zine/">here</a>.

<H3>Misc 3D Prints</H3>
<a href="https://3dprint.nih.gov/collections/covid-19-response">The NIH is maintaining a library of community-sourced 3D prints specifically useful during this crisis</a>. Examples include headbands for face shields and plastic clips to connect face mask straps to (thus protecting the ears)

"My novella “The Masque of the Red Death” is a tribute to Poe; it’s from my book Radicalized.
It’s the story of a plute who brings his pals to his luxury bunker during civlizational collapse
in the expectation of emerging once others have rebuilt ... And naturally – for anyone who’s 
read Poe – it doesn’t work out for them. They discover that humanity has a shared microbial destiny
and that you can’t shoot germs. That every catastrophe must be answered with solidarity, not
selfishness, if it is to be survived."
