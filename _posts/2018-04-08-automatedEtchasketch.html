<p>The Etch-a-Sketch is a classic toy, in which two knobs are used to independently control the horizontal and vertical movement of a pointed, which removes a dust coating from a plastic screen, leaving a semi-permentant trace. What if we attach stepper motors to the knobs and control them by computer, instead of by hand? There's several possible applications; one particularly well-suited to the Etch-a-Sketch is generative art based upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">Lindenmeyer systems</a>. These are often continuous, connected lines (the Etch-a-Sketch can not lift its pen up and down) and describe interesting patterns such as fractals and plant shapes.</p>

<p> This is fun, and also illustrates the principles behind automated production tools like CNC machines, laser cutters, and 3D printers. </p>
