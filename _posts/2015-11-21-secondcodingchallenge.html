<p>
We had so much fun at our <a href="http://recybery.space/event/2015/11/07/codingchallengeday/">Perl coding day</a> that we decided to have another one! To keep things interesting, the language we're using will be announced at the event. Nick is going to come up with a list of coding challenges that we'll tackle with cooperation and friendly competition!</p>
<p>The coding day will be 3-5 PM, Saturday, 21 November, at Internationalist Books in Carrboro. Bring a laptop! (Snacks are also welcome)</p>
<p><b>The Day Of!</b></p>
<p>We chose <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"> Rust</a> as the language for this challenge. It was a bit of a struggle even to put together a Fibonacci sequence generator - this language has a steep learning curve!</p>
<p>Here's a factorial calculator, demonstrating recursion:
<pre>
use std::io;

fn fibber (x:i32) -> i32{
	if x == 0 {
	return 0;
	}
	else if x == 1 {
	return 1;
	}
	else {
	return fibber(x-2) + fibber(x-1); }
}

fn main (){
	let mut input = String::new();
	io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).ok().expect("Failed to read line");
	let num_in: i32 = input.trim().parse().ok().expect("Please type a number!");
	println!("Fibonacci sequence number {} is {}", num_in , fibber(num_in));
	}

</pre></p>
<p>John also filled in the slow moments with an overview of lockpicking! </p>
