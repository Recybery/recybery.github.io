<p>
We had so much fun at our <a href="http://recybery.space/event/2015/11/07/codingchallengeday/">Perl coding day</a> that we decided to have another one! To keep things interesting, the language we're using will be announced at the event. Nick is going to come up with a list of coding challenges that we'll tackle with cooperation and friendly competition!</p>
<p>The coding day will be 3-5 PM, Saturday, 21 November, at Internationalist Books in Carrboro. Bring a laptop! (Snacks are also welcome)</p>
<!--<p>Here's a factorial calculator, demonstrating recursion:
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

$input = $ARGV[0];

sub factorial{
	my $num=shift;
	if ($num == 0){return 1;}
	else {return $num * factorial($num-1);}
}

print factorial($input);
print "\n"
</pre></p>-->
