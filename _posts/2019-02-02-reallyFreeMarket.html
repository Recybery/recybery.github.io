The Really Really Free Market is this weekend, so we're going to show up with the <a href="http://recybery.space/project/2019/01/26/neopixelRing/">NeoPixel ring </a> we've been experimenting with. There's <a href="https://github.com/Recybery/NeoPixelFunRing/tree/master/marching_rainbow_discrete">code written for rainbow chaser lights written, with adjustable speed and direction</a>, so we'll let people turn the potentiometer and press the button for free and talk to them about electronics and computer code.
