<p>One of Charlie's interests is remote sensing and environmental monitoring; there are several interesting applications:
<ul>
<li>gathering ecological data, such as the meteorological (temperature, humidity), the biological (animal noises), and the anthropological (light pollution from encroaching development). You can read some more about this <a href="https://topologicoceans.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/light-and-noise-in-the-anthropocene/">here at Charlie's blog</a> or at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140916211811/http://arkfab.org/?p=340">this archived ArkFab post.</a></li>
<li>Monitoring and automation of food production facilities, such as <a href="https://hackaday.com/2015/02/08/automated-mushroom-cultivation/">mycoponics</a> and <a href="https://makezine.com/projects/aquaponic-garden/">aquaponics</a>, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2012/06/05/large-scale-arduino-controlled-greenhouse-does-some-serious-farming/">greenhouses</a>, and <a href="https://makezine.com/projects/bees-sensors-monitor-hive-health/">apiaries</a>. </li>
<li>Smart homes </li>
</ul></p>

<p>This project aims to build a basic platform for monitoring the local environment, and ultimately build greenhouse and beehive monitors. </p>

<p>Adafruit provides combined temperature and humidity sensors, <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/dht">the DHT series</a>. Although we have one of the nicer DHT22 sensors, let's start off using the less expensive (though less precise and more limited) DHT11. </p>

<p>One quantity that might be interesting to measure is the difference in temperature and humidity between a controlled environment like a greenhouse, and a reference environment, like the outdoors. To measure this, it'll be important to compare the two sensors under identical conditions, to get an idea of the bias and noise between them. </p>

<p>For monitoring light levels, we'll start off using CdS-based photoresistors. </p>

<p>Eventually, it'll be good to look into <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13287">WiFi</a> and <a href="">SD card shields</a> for data logging and <a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/06/30/charge-any-device-anywhere-wit.html">solar-powered battery packs for long-term, remote operation.</a> </p>

<p>For beehive monitoring, we'll also want to get a scale with digital strain sensors. </p>

<p>Here's a github repository to track the project's code and data:</p>

<p>Here's about a day's worth of data from a single DHT11 sensor, some distance from a heat duct but in its direct path:</p>

<p>Clock time is the horizontal axis; the upper pane tracks relative humidity in percent, and the lower pane tracks temperature in degrees celcius. Much of the variation is due to an oscillation of about 30 minutes, with the sensor cooling and growing more humid until a spike of hot, dry air appears. This is the furnace cycling on and off. During the afternoon, the oscillations stop, but the temperature continues to drop. This is because the thermostat is in the living room, which gets direct sun; the sensor was in a rear room which is shaded. The living room stayed warm enough to keep from tripping the thermostat while the rear room, separated with a closed door, cooled.</p>

<p>There are lower-frequency changes too; the step-change in both temperature and humidity on midnight of the second day corresponds to a rainstorm arriving, for example.</p>
