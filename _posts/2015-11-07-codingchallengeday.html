<p>
Nick came up with a series of coding challenges ranging from basic (Hello World, a factorial calculator) to advanced (an RSA encryption algorithm) and we chose Perl as a coding language, since none of us knew it. Using built-in help pages and examples from the internet, we tackled these problems and learned basic Perl syntax!
</p>
<p>Here's a factorial calculator, demonstrating recursion:
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

$input = $ARGV[0];

sub factorial{
	my $num=shift;
	if ($num == 0){return 1;}
	else {return $num * factorial($num-1);}
}

print factorial($input);
print "\n"
</pre></p>
