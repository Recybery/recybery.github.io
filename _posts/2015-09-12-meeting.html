<p>We met this Saturday at iBooks and did some organizing and strategizing. A couple of things that we talked about:
<ul><li>Directions to take the website</li>
<li>What group- and subgroup-projects we want to pursue</li>
<li>Where to flier for outreach</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Also, Colin  gave an impromptu caligraphy lesson!</p>
