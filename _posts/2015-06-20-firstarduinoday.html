<p>We&#8217;ve had a couple of administrative, get-to-know-one-another meetings, so I&#8217;m pleased to report that we&#8217;ve had our first hands-on, project-driven gathering! A core of about three of us camped out in the lounge of Internationalist Books and jumped head-first into an Arduino microcontroller! This is a piece of technology which bridges computers and simple circuitry, so we learned a lot about electronics and coding, making it through the <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage">first few example circuits.</a></p>

<p>One of the projects on the table is an automated Etch-a-Sketch; perhaps the computer will have a steady hand and can finally draw a clean diagonal! That&#8217;s probably a while off, though. We&#8217;ll definitely have to master stepper motors first. But just messing around today we came up with a few more ideas. For the next get-together, we&#8217;re planning to write a text-to-Morse code converter!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re trying to get a schedule going: Saturday afternoons, 3-5 PM, at Interationalist Books (101 Lloyd St Carrboro)</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>

Some guidebooks refer to it by its older scientific names of Entoloma lividum or Rhodophyllus sinuatus. The largest mushro-->
