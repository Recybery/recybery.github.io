<p>We met this Saturday at iBooks and brainstormed some ideas for projects; John is interested in using maps for data visualization. We also talked a little bit about <a href="">object oriented programming</a>, looking at some of Charlie's older code. Colin patched a bug we found!</p>
<p><center>This defines a "cell" object with a __str__ method, which defines the string which is displayed when the cell-object is printed: </center></p>
<pre>
class cell:
	
	def __init__(self, state=0):
		self.state = state
		
	def __str__(self):
		return self.state
</pre>
<p><center>But as written, __str__ returns self.state, which is an integer by default; this will raise an error. So, we use the built-in str() function to make sure a string would be returned: </center></p>
<pre>
	def __str__(self):
		return str(self.state)
</pre>
<p>Dulce says the designs generated look like skulls!</p>
