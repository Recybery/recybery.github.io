<a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/08/29/characterizing-a-death-ray-er-solar-oven/"> Hack-A-Day featured Charlie's solar furnace!</a> It was built out of an old DirecTV satellite dish found in the woods, a couple hundred mirror chips, and a lot of hot glue.

Measurements taken show that it can deliver almost 50 Watts at maximum power, and a power flux of 45 kilowatts per square meter at its focus. This can easily ignite paper and cloth, burn through wood, and boil water.
