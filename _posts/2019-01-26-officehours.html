We're going to try out the "office hours" model for meetings, in which we show up and do orginizational work in an open and informal setting, with others welcome to watch or talk about the Recybery. If that sounds interesting to you, we'll be trying it out on Saturday, 12 Jan 2019. Charlie will be at Open Eye Cafe from 4 to 6pm. Some things we might be doing:
