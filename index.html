Welcome to the ReCybery, aka the Carrboro Computer Recyclery! We are a local, volunteer-run, not-for-profit collective that aspires to create a safe space for people to learn and teach, with a focus on the repurposing and fixing of used computers. We are working on many projects and anyone is welcome to join!

<h3>Story</h3>
A long time ago, in a condominium complex not too terribly far away, a group of ne'er-do-wells found themselves with a surplus of broken computer technology and an unused storage space under their unit. "Hey," they said, "Let's start dismantling this trash and building working machines with the parts!"
<p>

And so the Carrboro Computer Recyclery, aka the Recybery, was off and running, much to the horro of the local Home Owners' Association. We churned countless machine-hours of epidemiological models before the padlock went on the crawlspace door, and the Recybery went dormant.
<p>

Well, it's awake now!
